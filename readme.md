# UCF Header Bar

*For the OSI Agency Websites*

---

This Wordpress plugin adds the UCF header bar to all of the OSI Agency sites when "Network Activated" on the OSI Multisite Network.

**Warning**:  This uses code supplied by UCF.  They will update this code without warning, and it is liable to break sites (it has before).
